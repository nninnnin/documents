In WordPress, 'taxonomy' refers to a way of grouping and categorizing content.

('분류체계'를 의미한다.)



Essentially, it helps you organize and classify your posts, pages, and custom post types.



the two default taxonomies in WordPress are:



- categories
- tags



In addition to these, WordPress allows you to create custom taxonomies. 

This is useful when you need to group content in a way that doesn't fit into the default categories and tags.
