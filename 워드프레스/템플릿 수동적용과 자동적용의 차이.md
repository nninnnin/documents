### 템플릿 수동적용과 자동적용의 차이

In WordPress, there is indeed a distinction between how templates are applied to individual pages and how templates are assigned to category archives or other taxonomy terms.



#### Page Templates

For individual pages, you can select a specific template using Page Attributes section in the WP page editor.

#### Category Templates

For categories and other taxonomies, the **template hierarchy** determines which template file is used.

**Template files for categories**

WP looks for specific template files in the theme's directory to display category archives. The hierarchy is checked in the following order:

- `category-<slug>.php` : category by slug
- `category-<id>.php` : category by id
- `category.php` : generic template for all categories
- `archive.php` : more generic template for all archive-type pages
- `index.php` : fallback, if none of above are found
